This is a simple FAST subdomain and directory enumeration tool
The user is expected to make the file executable using 'chmod +x enumX' then moving it to '/usr/bin' to make it a binary (the file already contain a python shebang)

```
usage: enumX [-h] [-s] [-dir] -u Url -w Wordlist

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -s          Enable subdomain enumeration
  -dir        Enable directory enumeration
  -u U        Target URL or domain
  -w W        Path to wordlist file
                                                      
```
